# DFT-Based Channel Estimation in OFDM
MATLAB Simulation of LS vs DFT-Enhanced Channel Estimation
This project implements and compares Least Squares (LS) and DFT-based channel estimation techniques for an OFDM system operating over a Rayleigh frequency-selective fading channel.
The DFT-based estimator significantly improves estimation accuracy by exploiting the finite delay spread of real-world multipath channels.

## Project Overview

This MATLAB simulation demonstrates:

- 64-point OFDM system
- QPSK modulation
- Rayleigh multipath fading channel (8 taps)
- Block-type pilot-based estimation
- LS estimation
- DFT-based enhanced estimation
- Zero-Forcing (ZF) equalization
- BER & MSE performance evaluation (0–30 dB SNR)

The DFT estimator applies time-domain truncation to remove noise components from taps outside the true channel length, leading to significantly cleaner channel estimates.

## Simulation Results
1. MSE vs SNR

The DFT-based estimator provides an ~8× reduction in MSE across all SNR values.

|SNR (dB)|	MSE (LS)  |	MSE (DFT)   |
|---------|------------|------------|
|0	    | 1.003	     | 0.1268     |
|5	    | 0.3121     | 0.0408     |
|10	    | 0.1002     | 0.01254    |
|15	    | 0.03124    | 0.003906   |
|20	    | 0.009976   | 0.00131    |
|25	    | 0.003152   | 0.0004066  |
|30	    | 0.001005   | 0.0001293  |

2. BER vs SNR

DFT-based estimation achieves 40–50% lower BER, giving a clear SNR gain.

|SNR (dB)|	BER (LS)  |	BER (DFT)   |
|---------|------------|------------|
|0	    | 0.3127     | 0.2334     |
|5	    | 0.1763     | 0.1168     |
|10	    | 0.08097    | 0.04827    |
|15	    | 0.03048    | 0.01815    |
|20	    | 0.01059    | 0.005917   |
|25	    | 0.003116   | 0.001718   |
|30	    | 0.001214   | 0.0007367  |

## Key Insight

The DFT-based estimator:
- Converts LS estimate → time domain
- Keeps only first L taps (actual channel length)
- Zeroes out noise-dominated taps
- Converts back to frequency domain
  
This is the same technique used in 4G LTE and 5G NR receivers for high-accuracy channel estimation.

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates that DFT-based channel estimation provides:
- Much lower estimation error
- Cleaner channel impulse response
- Lower BER at all SNR levels
- Higher SNR efficiency
- Receiver behavior similar to LTE/5G PHY processing
  
The results match both theory and practical wireless system design.
