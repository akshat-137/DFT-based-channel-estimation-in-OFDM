# DFT-based-channel-estimation-in-OFDM
This project implements and evaluates a DFT-based channel estimation technique for an OFDM system and compares its performance with the conventional Least Squares (LS) estimator. The goal is to improve the accuracy of wireless channel estimation by exploiting the sparse multipath structure of real-world wireless channels.
